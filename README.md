Toast Escape
1. Story

In a distant world, a little toast lived happily with its friends. One day, however, a close friend was taken away by humans. Terrified, the toast and its buddies decided to abandon the human world. They fled deep into the forest — a place where freedom might still exist.

You’ll control the brave toast and its friends in an endless escape from the greedy stomachs of mankind. Jump over obstacles, rescue your fellow toasts, collect power-ups, and team up to break through sugary traps. The journey becomes more chaotic, and more adorable, than ever before!
